# Accuracy Improvement Strategies for Microbio AI

## Current Challenges
- Limited training data per class (some classes have <10 images)
- Class imbalance
- Model overfitting due to small dataset
- Need for better generalization

## Strategy 1: Data Augmentation ✅

- Applies realistic augmentations: rotation, brightness, contrast, noise, blur, sharpening, flips

### Implementation:
```bash
python data_augmentation.py
```

### Expected improvement: +5-10% accuracy

## Strategy 2: Advanced Model Architecture ✅

    # Stage 1: Freeze all layers except classifier
    # Stage 2: Unfreeze last 10 layers
    # Stage 3: Unfreeze last 20 layers
    # Stage 4: Unfreeze all layers with low learning rate
    pass
