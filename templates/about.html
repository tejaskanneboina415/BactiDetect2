    <h1>About BactiDetect</h1>
    <p>BactiDetect is an innovative project that combines artificial intelligence with microbiology to provide rapid, accurate bacterial classification. Our goal is to make advanced bacterial analysis accessible to researchers, healthcare professionals, and environmental scientists.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#7c5cff; font-weight:600;">This project was founded by Tejas Kanneboina.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We aim to revolutionize bacterial detection and classification by providing a user-friendly, AI-powered tool that can quickly identify various bacterial species from images. This technology has the potential to significantly impact fields such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, and food safety.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Our system uses a sophisticated machine learning model trained on thousands of bacterial colony images. When you upload an image, our AI analyzes the visual characteristics of the bacterial colonies and provides a classification with confidence scores.</p>

    <h2>Future Developments</h2>
    <p>We are continuously working to improve our model's accuracy and expand its capabilities. Future updates will include support for more bacterial species, enhanced image processing, and additional analysis features.</p>
