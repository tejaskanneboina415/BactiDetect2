# Microbio AI - Bacterial Classification System

A machine learning-based web application for classifying bacterial species from microscopic images.

## Features

- Real-time bacterial classification from uploaded images
- Support for multiple bacterial species
- Web-based interface for easy interaction
- Machine learning model trained on diverse bacterial datasets

## Technologies Used

- Python/Flask for backend
- TensorFlow/Keras for machine learning
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend
- Image processing and data augmentation

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python app.py`
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

1. Upload a microscopic image of bacteria
2. The system will analyze the image and provide classification results
3. View detailed information about the detected bacterial species

## Model Information

The system uses a deep learning model trained on multiple bacterial species including:
- Escherichia coli
- Staphylococcus aureus
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa
- And many more...
